# gray-correction
the correction for the 40khz pilot single

This code processes "graydata" which is a list of timestamps and powerlevels.  Each power level represents a frequancy depnding on how you FFT the raw data.

The code will allow you to enter in some paramiters that the fft used to generate the gray data so that you can accuratly locate the 40khz piolet signal
